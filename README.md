-This app uses two new React features, React styled components and React hooks
-Because we learned that functional components are usually better than class components,
the useState hook allows us to give state to functional components, yay!
-styled components allow us to get specific with our styling and define styles for components without
having everything mixed in one css file, yay!

APP GOALS
Database:
SHIRTS: name, category, imageUrl
PANTS: name, category, imageUrl

COMPONENTS
FORM to add in a top and bottom
CLOSET_DISPLAY that show a current top and bottom image, with arrow buttons to flip through
tops and bottoms like a slideshow

to be continued...
-most importantly-need to research more how to use store with functional components and useState hook!
-so I can connect the database I have seeded and utilize my routes/models.
-a SAVE button that will save the currently displayed top and bottom as an outfit
-an OUTFITS component will show saved outfits 
-generate an outfit based on some characteristcs/extra fields of items(a dressy top and bottom, a neutral top and bottom, etc..)
-a model to hold OUTFITS, which are saved combos of tops and bottoms
